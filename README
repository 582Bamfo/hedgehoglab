Deploying Docker containers on Amazon ECS (container orchestration)

Cloud provider is AWS.

Note: everything need to be codified, versioned controlled and automated

IAAC ,terraform was used to provisioned the ECS infrastructure. 

Ansible was used for configuration management of the ECS server

All the codes/scripts were versioned controlled using git/github

CICD pipeline(PAAC) was implemented to automate the all the stages using jenkins with various plugin including sonarQube, docker/docker-compose, amazon ecr, dockerhub, git,Ecs server.

There was continues development, intergration, testing , delivery and monitoring of the code/application.

The application code  were stored in SCM -git/github. Jenkins pull the codes and performed code analysis/ test using sonarqube.
After passing the quality gate the codes were build by docker. 
The build result/artifact was store in AWS ecr. After continues testing the artifact was delivered to AWS plafform using Amazon ECS as container deployment, scaling and management. 
Amazon cloudwatch was used continues monitoring
